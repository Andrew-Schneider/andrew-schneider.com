## What Happened
I spent my senior year with most of my brain devoted to thinking about robots

### Prelude
What is FRC?
	FRC is an initialism that stands for "First Robotics Competition". It's a world-wide High School competition that pits over 3,800 teams, 90,000 students against each other in 3 vs 3 task based matches. You can learn more [Here](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/what-is-first-robotics-competition).

### Part 1: Fall 2019
For my team, and I believe most others as well, the Fall is spent recruiting new members and bringing them up to speed on our workflow and best practices as fast as possible. We also work miscellanious long-term projects, such as updates to the internal team wiki, workshop improvements, and Stem outreach.

Most of my time during this semester was spent teaching new members of the design team the basics of the design process and the fundamentals of FRC robot design. The curriculum was made up of presentations intermixed with creative thinking problems and then small CAD challenges later on.

### Part 2: Spring 2020
The second semester begins with the game kickoff, a livestreamed event that details the rules and contents of the game.
